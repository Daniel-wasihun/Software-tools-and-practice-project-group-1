all group member you must be participate at least at one question on the project 
and you need to test the program you have coded 
and then you will push the project to this repo 
if the question you worked on is worked by another person / collaborator you must merge the conflicts that have maded

in addition to this working on the same project / ptogram is appropriated
you can get bonus points by doing it

thanks !
